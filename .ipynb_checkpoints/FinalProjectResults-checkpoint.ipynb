    "free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged\n",
    "unless they cancel first. If the student clicks \"access course materials\", they will be able to view\n",
    "the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified\n",
    "certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.\n",
    "In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked \"start free trial\", they\n",
    "were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. If the student indicated 5\n",
    "or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they\n",
    "indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses\n",

    "student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have\n",

    "without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and\n",

    "## Section 3: Analyzing results\n",
    " \n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for you to analyze is here. This data contains the raw information needed to compute\n",
    "the above metrics, broken down day by day. Note that there are two sheets within the\n",
    "spreadsheet - one for the experiment group, and one for the control group.\n",
    "The meaning of each column is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pageviews: Number of unique cookies to view the course overview page that day.\n",
    "* Clicks: Number of unique cookies to click the course overview page that day.\n",
    "* Enrollments: Number of user-ids to enroll in the free trial that day.\n",
    "* Payments: Number of user-ids who who enrolled on that day to remain enrolled for 14\n",
    "days and thus make a payment. (Note that the date for this column is the start date, that\n",
    "is, the date of enrollment, rather than the date of the payment. The payment happened\n",
    "14 days later. Because of this, the enrollments and payments are tracked for 14 fewer\n",
    "days than the other columns.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sanity Checks\n",
    "Start by checking whether your invariant metrics are equivalent between the two groups. If the\n",
    "invariant metric is a simple count that should be randomly split between the 2 groups, you can\n",
    "use a binomial test as demonstrated in Lesson 5. Otherwise, you will need to construct a\n",
    "confidence interval for a difference in proportions using a similar strategy as in Lesson 1, then\n",
    "check whether the difference between group values falls within that confidence level.\n",
    "If your sanity checks fail, look at the day by day data and see if you can offer any insight into\n",
    "what is causing the problem.\n",
    "Check for Practical and Statistical Significance\n",
    "Next, for your evaluation metrics, calculate a confidence interval for the difference between the\n",
    "experiment and control groups, and check whether each metric is statistically and/or practically\n",
    "significance. A metric is statistically significant if the confidence interval does not include 0 (that\n",
    "is, you can be confident there was a change), and it is practically significant if the confidence\n",
    "interval does not include the practical significance boundary (that is, you can be confident there\n",
    "is a change that matters to the business.)\n",
    "If you have chosen multiple evaluation metrics, you will need to decide whether to use the\n",
    "Bonferroni correction. When deciding, keep in mind the results you are looking for in order to\n",
    "launch the experiment. Will the fact that you have multiple metrics make those results more\n",
    "likely to occur by chance than the alpha level of 0.05?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Run Sign Tests\n",
    "For each evaluation metric, do a sign test using the day-by-day breakdown. If the sign test does\n",
    "not agree with the confidence interval for the difference, see if you can figure out why.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Make a Recommendation\n",
    "Finally, make a recommendation. Would you launch this experiment, not launch it, dig deeper,\n",
    "run a follow-up experiment, or is it a judgment call? If you would dig deeper, explain what area\n",
    "you would investigate. If you would run follow-up experiments, briefIy describe that experiment.\n",
    "If it is a judgment call, explain what factors would be relevant to the decision."

This change does seem to suceed in discouraging strudents to not start trials in case they don't have time to study, it does not increase the eventual course payment rate which is likely the goal."
