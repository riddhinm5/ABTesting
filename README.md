# Overview of A/B testing

## Steps to set up an A/B test

1. Decide on change
2. Chose a Metric
3. review statistics (observational)
4. Design the test
5. Analyze results

## Ethics of setting up an A/B test

Things to keep in mind:

1. Risk to participants
2. Benefit - what will the experiment yield
3. Choice - for instance: can provide the users the choice to select privacy level
4. Privacy - how is the user privcy protected in the data (make data not personally identifiable)

## Steps to selecting metrics for an experiment

1. Define problem and suitable metrics
2. Build intuition - measure the change between control and expt & the variability of the metric
3. Characterize

## Steps to design an experiment

1. Choose the subject
2. Choose the "population"
3. Calculate Size of both classes needed
4. Calculate the time the experiment needs to run

## Steps to Analyze results of an A/B test

1. Sanity Check
2. Choose single metric or multiple metrics
3. Calculate change
4. Check for statistical significance
5. Sign test - Positive/Negative change
6. Statistical significance of sign test
