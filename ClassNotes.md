# Class Notes

Below are my class notes from the Udacity AB testing class

## Lecture 1

### Kind of questions A/B testing can answer

    * A/B testing cannot be used to ask general questions like is my site complete. A/B testing as described by some Silicon Valley VCs can tell you if you are going "up" a hill it can't tell you which of a new hill to climb
    * Cannot use A/B testing for a brand new feature because
        1. There is no baseline metrics to test the new feature against in order to state an "improvement"
        2. There may be a novelty effect causing a larger than normal engagement as users explore the feature
