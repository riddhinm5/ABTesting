    "free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged\n",
    "unless they cancel first. If the student clicks \"access course materials\", they will be able to view\n",
    "the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified\n",
    "certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.\n",
    "In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked \"start free trial\", they\n",
    "were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. If the student indicated 5\n",
    "or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they\n",

    "student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have\n",

    "without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and\n",
